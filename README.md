An Android quiz app that tests your knowledge on YGO(Yu-Gi-Oh!) cards using Yugipedia's API.
As you get cards they are saved locally on your phone.
While you don't have an internet connection you can still play, however you will only get saved cards.

You can see how many you've got right as it will say "Answered:X".
If you get a question wrong it will reset to 0.
If you are at 0 it will display your High Score, instead.
(By "High Score" it means the highest amount of times you got the right cards in a row)

You can only get cards that are in Master Duel.
The rarities are based on Master Duels' rarities.
When you have at least 50 cards saved locally, you will only then get questions on card names.
When you have at least 50 monster cards, you will only then get questions on monsters' ATK(Attack) and DEF(Defense).

There is a button that will download cards until you have 100 cards saved.
If you don't have an internet connection when you open the app the button won't appear.
Also, if you already have 100 or more cards saved the button also won't appear.

The app will always remember the question that you were on.
